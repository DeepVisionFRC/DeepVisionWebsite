            <center><h2>DeepVision Entrepreneurs in Robotics</h2></center>

<p>DeepVision is a high school robotics team formed from the ground up by a group of students who want to experience the robotics competition circuit as a multi-school, independent team.
<br><br>
The mission of DeepVision is to provide a rich, hands on experience for each student, with no mentor or parent hands touching the robot or the software. This is different from most established teams in that everything is created, tested and brought to competition by the students. As this is the team’s rookie year, there is no existing infrastructure or code to re-purpose. The possibilities for creativity and innovation are endless. The opportunity to build a robot of this kind with no adult supervision or interference is a rare experience and the team looks forward to initiating a team in which students have the freedom to learn and create together.
<br><br>
DeepVision is entering the competition circuit with FIRST Robotics in in 2018.
<br><br>
Current corporate sponsors include: Apple, Artiman Venture Partners and Oracle.
